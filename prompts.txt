USER:I'm about to graduate high school and I'm having anxiety because I haven't picked a major course of study for college yet.

I'm supposed to pick based on my interests and whatnot, but my only interests are video games and anime cartoon shows.  I can't seem to come up with anything solid based on those.

Jealousy is often thought of in the context of romantic relationships: a boyfriend who forbids his girlfriend from talking to other men, for instance, or a person who can't stand to see her old flame post pictures with a new partner on Facebook. But the feeling can occur in almost every type of human relationship - from siblings competing for parental attention to coworkers trying to impress a respected boss.
Although jealousy is a painful emotional experience, evolutionary psychologists regard it not as an emotion to be suppressed but as one to heed - as a signal or a wake-up call that a valued relationship is in danger and that steps need to be taken to regain the affection of a mate or friend. As a result, jealousy is seen as a necessary emotion, because it preserves social bonds and motivates people to engage in behaviors that maintain important relationships.
